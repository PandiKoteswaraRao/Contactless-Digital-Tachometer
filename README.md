Tachometer using PIC Microcontroller

A digital tachometer is a digital device that measures and indicates the speed of a rotating object. A rotating object may be a bike tyre, a car tyre or a ceiling fan, or any other motor, and so on. A digital tachometer circuit comprises LCD or LED read out and a memory for storage. Digital tachometers are more common these days and they provide numerical readings instead of dials and needles.

The word tachometer is derived from two Greek words: tachos means “speed” and metron means “to measure”. It works on the principle of a tachometer generator, which means when a motor is operated as a generator, it produces the voltage according to the velocity of the shaft. It is also known as revolution-counter, and its operating principle can be electromagnetic, electronic or optical-based. Power, accuracy, RPM range, measurements and display are the specifications of a tachometer. Tachometers can be analog or digital indicating meters; however, this article focuses only on the digital tachometers.

Digital Tachometer Types :-

Digital tachometers are classified into four types based on the data acquisition and measurement techniques.

Based on the data acquisition technique, the tachometers are of the following types:
1.Contact type
2.Non Contact type

Based on the measurement technique, the tachometers are of the following types:
1.Time measurement
2.Frequency measurement

Non Contact type :-
A tachometer that does not need any physical contact with the rotating shaft is called as noncontact digital tachometer. In this type, a laser or an optical disk is attached to the rotating shaft, and it can be read by an IR beam or laser, which is directed by the tachometer.

This type of tachometer can measure from 1 to 99,999 rpm; the measurement angle is less than 120 degrees, and the tachometer has a five-digit LCD display. These types of tachometers are efficient, durable, accurate, and compact, and also visible from long distance.
